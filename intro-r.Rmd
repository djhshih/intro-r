Yet your fingers usually type the right key.


## Is R the only programming language you will ever need?

Programming languages used in Github repositories authored by **Hadley Wickham**:

- R
- Ruby
- C, C++
- Javascript
- Bash


## R background and use case

\includegraphics[width=50px]{img/rlogo.png}

- Open-source programming environment (GPLv2)
- First released in 1993
- Derived from statistical programming language S
- Routinely tested across major platforms:  
  Linux, Windows, MacOS, Solaris

----

\includegraphics[width=50px]{img/rlogo.png}

- *Not* a great general-purpose programming language
- *Not* performant (unless used carefully)
- Inconsistent syntax, type system, function names, ...
- Rife with landmines ![](img/warning.png){width=10px}
- ~~Paucity of help resources~~

----

Despite all of its shortcomings,

\includegraphics[width=50px]{img/rlogo.png}

- fueled by **open-source software package repositories**
- used by many statisticians, quantitative analysts, data scientists, 
  bioinformaticians, and computational biologists

R is *not* a Swiss-army knife,  
but R packages empower *statistical analysis* and *data science*!


## RStudio

## Why R is useful: R software repositories

**Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("io");
```

**Bioconductor**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R");
biocLite("limma");
```

----

**R-Forge**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("partykit",
  repos="http://r-forge.r-project.org");
```

**Git repositories** (Github, Bitbucket, Gitorious ...)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools);
install_github("hadley/devtools");
```


## Using R effectively: Thinking in terms of vectors

```{r}
# make a vector with values 1 to 5
x <- 1:5;
x

# add one to each element of x
for (i in 1:length(x)) {
  x[i] <- x[i] + 1;
}

x
```

----

We can write the same command more succinctly:

```{r}
# make a vector with values 1 to 5
x <- 1:5;
x

# add one to each element of x
x <- x + 1;
x
```

----

If vectors have different lengths, the shorter vector is repeated.

```{r}
x <- 1:5;
y <- 2:6;

x + y
```

----

\warning If vectors have different lengths, the shorter vector is repeated.

```{r}
1:4 + 1:2
1:4 + 1:3
```

## Learning the nouns of the R language: Data types

- `vector`
- `matrix` and `array`
- `factor`
- `list` and `data.frame`
- S3, S4, RC, and R6 objects


## Logical, integer, numeric, and character vectors

Vectors are the most basic data types in R.

A vector is a collection of values, often constructed with `c()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
c(1, 3, 1, 5)
c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
c("apple", "orange", "banana")
```

A single value (i.e. singleton) is actually a `vector` with length 1.

```{r}
x <- 1;
length(x)
```

----

Elements of a `vector` must be all the same type.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
logical(5)
integer(5)
numeric(5)
character(5)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
complex(5)
raw(5)
```

----

Logical vectors can be constructed by

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rep(TRUE, 4)
c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
```

Integer vectors can be constructed by

```{r, eval=FALSE}
1:5
seq(1, 6, 2)
rep(3L, 5)
c(2L, 1L, 9L, 4L, 6L)
```

----

Subsetting a vector

```{r}
x <- c(3, 1, 2, 4);
x[1]
x[2:3]
x[-1]
```

----

\question How can you get the second and the fourth element?

```{r}
x <- c(3, 1, 2, 4);
x
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x[c(2, 4)]
```

----

\warning A `character vector` is really a vector of strings of single characters.

```{r}
x <- "R is useful.";
length(x)
nchar(x)
```

----

\warning The vector type can be **coerced** as needed.

```{r}
x <- 1:5;
x

x[3] <- "a";
x
```

An object is coerced into the more flexible type.

----

\question What do you get when you create a vector by concatenating
your favourite shape and your favourite number together?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
c("circle", pi)
```

----

Many functions are available for casting objects of one type to another:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
as.logical
as.character
as.integer
as.numeric
```


## Matrix and array

A `matrix` object is typically constructed from a `vector`, by specifying the
dimensions of the matrix. The elements are arranged in *column-major order* by
default.

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:6, nrow=2);
x
```

----

We can get the dimensions of a matrix using the functions `nrow`, `ncol`, and
`dim`.

```{r}
nrow(x)
ncol(x)
dim(x)
```

----

We can access an element by specifying the row and column indices.

```{r}
x[1, 2]
```

When any index is omitted, then it is equivalent to selecting all the elements
in the corresponding dimension.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x[1, ]
x[1, 1:ncol(x)]
```

----

Selecting a row or column from a `matrix` results in `vector` object.

```{r}
class(x)
class(x[1, ])
class(x[, 2])
```

----

We can also select a sub-matrix by selecting multiple row or columns.

```{r}
y <- x[, 2:3];
y
class(y)
```

----

To delete a row or a column, we can use a negative index and assign
the new `matrix` object to the same variable (or a new variable).

```{r}
y <- x[, -2];
y
```

----

\warning Automatic coercion is convenient but may also cause unanticipated behaviour.

```{r}
y <- x[, 3];
class(y)
nrow(y)
```

----

To prevent coercion, set the `drop` argument to `FALSE`.

```{r}
y <- x[, 3, drop=FALSE];
class(y)
nrow(y)
```

----

We can combine matries or vectors together horizontally by

```{r}
y <- cbind(x[, 1:2], x[, 2:3]);
y
```

----

Similarly, `rbind` can be used to bind two matrices (or vectors) together vertically.

\question How can you combine vertically the first two elements in the first row of `x`
and the last two elements in the second row of `x`?

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:6, nrow=2);
x
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
rbind(x[1, 1:2], x[2, 2:3])
```

## Factor

`factor`s are useful for representing categorical variables and discrete variables.

```{r}
x <- factor(c("apple", "orange", "apple",
  rep("banana", 4)));
x
```

----

Internally, a `factor` is represented as an integer vector with a `levels`
attribute that stores the labels for each level (category).

```{r}
str(x)
attributes(x)
```

----

\warning `factor` may behave like an `integer` vector or like a `character` 
vector, depending on the function.

Therefore, when passing a factor to a function, it is advisable
to explictly cast factor to `character` or `integer`, depending 
on which vector the function expects.

```{r}
sum(as.integer(x))
nchar(as.character(x))
```

## List

Elements of a `list` can be different types;
a `list` is a **heterogeneous container**.

```{r}
line <- list(
  name = "segment",
  start = c(0.1, 3.2),
  end = c(1.4, 0.2)
);
```

----

A `list` element is accessed by

```{r}
line[[2]]
line$start
```

----

A sublist of a `list` is accessed by

```{r}
line[2]
line[2:3]  # equivalent: line[c("start", "end")]
```

## Data frame

`data.frame` is an object useful for storing data in tabular format.

`data.frame` is a special type of `list` where all the elements have the same length.

Often, input data is stored as a comma-delimited file (CSV), and we can
read the data by

```{r, eval=FALSE}
d <- read.csv("data/matched.csv");
```

Different data formats are read using different functions.
If we had a tab-delimited file whose first row is the column names, then

```{r, eval=FALSE}
d <- read.table("data/matched.tsv", header=TRUE);
```

----

The `io` package could simplify file input and output by
automatically choosing the correct function based on the
file extension:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(io);

d1 <- qread("data/matched.csv");
d2 <- qread("data/matched.tsv");

qwrite(d1, "data/matched.rds");
```


## Attributes and S3 class

All of the data types introduced so far are actually S3 classes.

Use `str` to inspect an R object.

Use `attributes` to inspect the attributes of an R variable.

A variable's `class` controls which S3 function is called.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
print
print.default
print.factor
print.data.frame
print.function
```

----

Create a new S3 class by specifying the `class` attribute:

```{r}
x <- 1:6;
class(x) <- "newton";
x

structure(1:6, class="newton")
```


## Other classes: S4, RC, and R6

Most of R use **S3** classes (and rely on the `class` attribute).

**S4** classes provides more object-oriented language features.
Most Bioconductor packages use S4 classes.
Rcpp modules expose C++ classes as S4 classes.

**Reference class** (**RC**), also known as R5, provides *mutatble* objects. (*Not* widely used)

**R6** class is provided by the [R6](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R6) package; it offers more features and better performance. (*Not* widely used)


## Finding and reading documentation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?install.packages
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?t.test
t.test
stats:::t.test.default
```


## Verbs: Loops and apply functions

In a system-level programming language,

```{r}
x <- LETTERS[1:3];

y <- character(length(x));
for (i in 1:length(x)) {
  y[i] <- paste(x[i], "is a letter.");
}

y
```

----

In R, most functions behave correctly for vectors:

```{r}
y <- paste(x, "is a letter.")
```

The functions that only accept singleton/scalar variables may be extended
to operate on different objects with multiple elements: 


object             function
----------------   -----------
`list`             `lapply`
`vector`           `vapply`
`matrix`           `apply`
grouped `vector`   `tapply`
multiple `list`s   `mapply`

`dplyr` library provides functions useful for manipulating `data.frame`s.

----

```{r}
s <- list(
  x = c(1, 3, 1, 2),
  y = c(1, 3, 2)
);

lapply(s, mean)
```

## Conditionals: if-expression and logical vector indexing

If-expression evaluates either one branch or another, conditioned
on the result of a logical expression.

```{r}
z <- sample(1:10, size=1);

if (z < 3) {
  "small"
} else {
  "big"
}
```

----

The `ifelse` returns results based on a `logical vector`: 

```{r}
z <- c(3, 9, 1, 6, 8);

ifelse(z > 5, -1, 1)
```

----

\question For the sake of equitability... how you can double elements
of `z` that are less than five and halve elements of `z` that are greater 
than five?

```{r}
z <- c(3, 9, 1, 6, 8);
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ifelse(z < 5, z * 2, z / 2)
```

----

Earlier, we showed that we can subset a `matrix` using an `integer vector`.
We can also use a `logical vector` to select rows or columns from a `matrix`.

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:6, nrow=2);

i <- x > 3;
x[i]
```

```{r}
x[x %% 2 == 0]
```

----

\question How can you select rows of `x` where the values in the first column
of `x` are greater than one? 

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:6, nrow=2);
x
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x[x[,1] > 1, ]
```

----

\question How can you select values of `x` that are odd?

```{r}
x <- matrix(sample(1:6), nrow=2);
x
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x[x %% 2 == 1]
```

----

\warning Subsetting a matrix may return:

1. `matrix`, when row and column dimensions are both $> 1$; or
2. `vector`, when either the row or the column dimension is 1

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:6, nrow=2);

i <- x[1, ] > 1;
nrow(x[, i]) == 2

j <- which(x[1, ] > 3);
nrow(x[, j]) == 2
```

----

\question How can you fix the following code so that it returns
either `TRUE` or `FALSE`?

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:6, nrow=2);

j <- which(x[1, ] > 3);
nrow(x[, j]) == 2
```


## Functions and scope

A function can be defined by

```{r}

halve <- function(a) {
  a / 2
}
```

The scope of `a` is enclosed by the braces.

Outside the function body of `halve`, the object `a` does not exist.

----

Caller's local objects *cannot* be modified by the function

- cf. Fortan and Julia, where all caller's variables are modifiable
- cf. Python, where caller's mutable variables are modifiable
- cf. Java, where caller's reference-type variables are modifiable

```{r}
# Swap elements i and j of vector x
swap_elements <- function(x, i, j) {
  z <- x[i];
  x[i] <- x[j];
  x[j] <- z;
}
```

----

```{r}
outside <- 1:10;
outside

swap_elements(outside, 1, 10);
outside
```

----

To update an object, the function must return the modified object,
and the caller must re-assign its own object.

```{r}
# Swap elements i and j of vector x
swap_elements <- function(x, i, j) {
  z <- x[i];
  x[i] <- x[j];
  x[j] <- z;
  x
}

outside <- 1:10;
outside <- swap_elements(outside, 1, 10);
outside
```


## Workflow: input, plotting, analysis

\question Your colleague conducted an experiment where she randomly
assigned students into control and treatment groups. Both groups
are given the same homework assignments weekly.

In the control group ($n = 20$), the assignments are *not* graded.

In the treatment group ($n = 21$), the assignments are graded.

At the end of the course, all students take a graded final exam.

She wishes to find out whether assignment grading affects
the students' grade on the final exam.

Final exam grades for both groups are availabe in the `data/control.txt`
and `data/treatment.txt`.

Useful R functions include:
`read.table`, `hist`, `boxplot`, `summary`, and `wilcox.test`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
set.seed(1234);
g1 <- 100 - rpois(20, 25);
g2 <- 100 - rpois(21, 20);
write.table(g1, "data/control.txt", row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE);
write.table(g2, "data/treatment.txt", row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE);
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# read input data

g1 <- read.table("data/control.txt", header=FALSE)[,1];
g2 <- read.table("data/treatment.txt", header=FALSE)[,1];

# plot input data

hist(g1)
hist(g2)

qqnorm(g1)
qqnorm(g2)

boxplot(g1, g2, names=c("control", "treatment"), xlab="group", ylab="final exam grade")

# descriptive statistics

summary(g1)
summary(g2)

# test hypothesis using statistical test

wilcox.test(g1, g2, alternative="two.side", paired=FALSE)
```

## Syntax: Punctuation and Formatting

Classical Latin and many other ancient written languages had no punctuation or
formatting (spaces and indentations), which are features of modern languages.

In programming languages, punctuations and formatting similarly serve to 
improve clarity and reduce ambiguity in programming languages. However, 
some programming languages rely more on punctuations, while others rely 
more on formatting.

In R, the semicolon punctuation (`;`) demarcate the end of statements.
This is optional but can help the R syntax parser produce clearer debugging
message and help pinpoint possible syntax error.
Indeed, since the R parser ignores *most* whitespace (including space, new line, carriage return,
and tab characters) in a script, a human reader who relies on formatting may misinterpret R code.

----

Python, in contrast, relies on whitespace formatting (e.g. indentation) for syntax parsing.
Thus, the use of semicolon is discouraged in Python.

In other words, the R parser reads code as a prose, and the Python
parser reads code as a poem.

Code in this document use the following convention:  
*Statements always end with semicolons, while expressions never do.*

**Statements** generally do not return any (meaningful) value, while **expressions**
always return a value.

The Matlab language effectively adopts this convention, and the Rust language
enforces it as a syntax rule.


## Copy-on-write mechanism

Implements the R language feature that caller's objects are not modified 
by a function.

- arguments are passed by reference;  
  a copy of the object is made whenever function modifies it
- also implemented in Matlab/Octave

```{r}
x <- 1:10;
y <- x;      # x and y refer to the same memory address
y[3] <- -3;  # now, a copy of x is made and y refers to the new modified copy
x
y
```


## Lazy argument evaluation

- arguments are evaluated only when it is needed
- cf. eager evaluations in C++, Fortran, etc. 

```{r}
# Evaluate a if x is TRUE; evaluate b otherwise.
eval_if_else <- function(x, a, b) {
  if (x) {
    a
  } else {
    b
  }
}

eval_if_else(TRUE, print("Sunny!"), print("Cloudy"));
```


## Interoperate with C++ using Rcpp

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(Rcpp);

cppFunction("
// Return the n-th Fibonacci number
int fib(unsigned int n) {
  if (n == 0) return 0;
  if (n == 1) return 1;
  return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
}
", verbose=FALSE);

fib(10)
```
